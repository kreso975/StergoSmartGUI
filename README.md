## üí° Switch
> [!NOTE]
> HTTP - Read Status (On/Off), Turn ON (url), Turn OFF (url)  
> MQTT - Turn ON/OFF | Values: On = 1, Off = 0    
> Discord Webhook publishes switch status to your Discord channel    

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have Manual switch and you don't mind when Homebridge is rebooted, your device is going to be set as OFF
> then you don't have to use Parameter urlStatus. 
>  
> How to setup Discord Webhooks: [link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use HTTP or MQTT not both for same accessory.  
>   
> Parameters required in Config:  
> 
> deviceType = 'Switch',  
> deviceName = 'Name your Accessory',  
> deviceID = 'Put something unique / chars and numbers',  
> urlON = 'URL that triggers your device to change state to ON',  
> urlOFF = 'URL that triggers your device to change state to OFF'

> [!CAUTION]
> Parameter:
> urlStatus = 'url points to JSON with device status' when is set it will bind Accessory to 5 sec check status interval
